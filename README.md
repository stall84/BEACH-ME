# BEACH-ME !
### A react/redux web-application that provides the user, having an urgent need to get the heck out of town, with a listing of the 5 nearest beaches, their travel-times, and a 5 day weather forecast for those beach/towns.

#### Utilizes Google's Distance Matrix, and OpenWeatherMap.org's API(s)

#### Permission for the browser to 'know' the user's location is required for normal functionality, 'Anonymously' entering an address or zipcode for user's current/origin location is expected in later versions.

#### User can easily click-through the hyper-linked list of nearest beaches to be taken to Google Map's directions/trip-overview

#### Current Version is limited to a 'database' of 25 beaches, all of which are in the Southeastern United States. Expansion to entire United States is being planned for later versions
